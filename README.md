# Data-Science-Projects
A compilation of projects for the Intro to Data Science, Data Science Toolbox, and Image Processing classes.

### Covid-19 Prediction 
This project predicts future covid-19 cases using linear regression. Made for the Intro to Data Science class.
##### Modules:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn

### Fruit Classification
The project loads a dataset of apples, bananas, and oranges that are either ripe or rotten and creates. These images were trained in a Convolution Neural Network using those images. The model was then tested using a testing dataset. Made for the Image Processing class.
##### Modules:
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
